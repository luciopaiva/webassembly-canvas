# WebAssembly canvas experiment

Simple WebAssembly experiment based on [this good tutorial](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2018/04/26/webassembly-by-hand.html).

This first approach defines a function that just returns a constant value.

To build it:

    node compile-save-and-run

It will automatically run the compiled code, asserting that it worked.
